# genetic-algorithm-trajectory-inversion
MATLAB codes to invert for the trajectory of meteor. The trajecotry is constrained based on the parameters: vel (in m/s), x0, y0, gamma, delta, t0.

- ```vel -> speed```
- ```gamma -> azimuth```
- ```delta -> elevation angle```
- ```(x0,y0) -> the termination point```
- ```t0 -> the expected time at the termination point```

## Two Assumptions:
1. the meteor penetrates linearly through the atmosphere with a constant velocity
2. the shockwave speed of 320 m/s is uniform in the atmosphere

## Run
run the main matlab script:

```ga_test.m```

- add contents of `sac_matlab` dir to your MATLAB path
- change the number of run `numrun` to considerably high value (e.g. 20) to estimate reliable output.
- change the lower and upper limits of the trajectory parameters.
- change the observed arrival times of the shockwaves, `dobs` in the script `fit_arrival_times.m`
- the coordinates of the stations are obtained directly from the sac headers of the seismograms. script: `get_stations_coords.m`
